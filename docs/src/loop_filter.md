# Loop Filter

The loop filters are provided by
[TrackingLoopFilters.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGNSS/TrackingLoopFilters.jl). This includes:
- first order loop filter `FirstOrderLF`
- second order bilinear loop filter `SecondOrderBilinearLF`
- second order boxcar loop filter `SecondOrderBoxcarLF`
- third order bilinear loop filter `ThirdOrderBilinearLF`
- third order boxcar loop filter `ThirdOrderBoxcarLF`
- third order assisted bilinear loop filter `ThirdOrderAssistedBilinearLF` (combines PLL and FLL)

## Default Configuration

The default Doppler estimator is `ConventionalAssistedPLLAndDLL` which uses:
- `ThirdOrderAssistedBilinearLF` for the carrier loop (FLL-assisted PLL for improved dynamics)
- `SecondOrderBilinearLF` for the code loop

The default bandwidths are:
- Carrier loop: 18 Hz
- Code loop: 1 Hz

## Custom Configuration

You can customize the loop filters and bandwidths when creating the Doppler estimator:

```jldoctest custom_loop
julia> using Tracking, GNSSSignals, TrackingLoopFilters

julia> using Tracking: Hz

julia> # Use non-assisted PLL with custom loop filter types
       doppler_estimator = ConventionalPLLAndDLL(
           ThirdOrderBilinearLF,      # carrier loop filter type
           SecondOrderBilinearLF;     # code loop filter type
           carrier_loop_filter_bandwidth = 15.0Hz,
           code_loop_filter_bandwidth = 0.5Hz
       );

julia> track_state = TrackState(; signals = (GPSL1CA(),), doppler_estimator);

julia> add_satellite!(track_state; prn = 1, code_phase = 50.0, carrier_doppler = 1000.0Hz);
```

## Custom Loop Filters

You can implement a custom loop filter `MyLoopFilter <: AbstractLoopFilter`. In this
case, a specialized `filter_loop` function is needed. For more information
refer to [TrackingLoopFilters.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGNSS/TrackingLoopFilters.jl).

## Custom Doppler Estimator

To replace the loop-filter-based estimator with a different algorithm
(Kalman filter, joint-channel estimator, …), see the dedicated guide
in [`custom_doppler_estimator.md`](custom_doppler_estimator.md).
